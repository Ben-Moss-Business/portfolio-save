      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Ben, a web developer who builds clean, responsive, and engaging digital experiences. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Three.js to bring ideas to life.
        <br><br>
        I approach every project with a learning mindset, openness to feedback, and a drive for continuous improvement. For me, great work starts with a solid attitude: showing up ready, taking ownership, and staying positive no matter the challenge.
        <br><br>
        Outside of coding, I’m all about adventure, rock climbing, watersports, and exploring the outdoors. I love anything that pushes me physically and mentally. I’m also into music and enjoy the creativity it brings, whether I’m solving a tricky bug or climbing a cliff face.

      <h1>My work</h1>
      <p>Here’s a selection of the projects I’ve worked on, showcasing my skills in web development and UI design. From building responsive client websites like Alexandra Dench Therapies, to dynamic applications like the Movie Wishlist app and my own interactive portfolio, each project reflects a focus on user experience and clean design. I’ve been working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, alongside modern frameworks and tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap.</p>

          <h3>Alexandra Dench Therapies</h3>
          <p>This website was created for a counselling psychologist to offer an inviting and informative platform for prospective clients. It features a clean layout, accessible service information, and contact functionality, all designed to foster trust and ease of navigation. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project also integrates APIs to enhance interactivity for example, form handling. It reflects strong fundamental web development skills with thoughtful UX design and real-world functionality.</p>

            <p>The Movie Wishlist app is a sleek, responsive web application that allows users to search and discover movies via a visually engaging interface. Built with React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, the app connects to a movie database API to fetch live movie data including posters, titles, and descriptions. This integration adds real-time dynamic content and demonstrates my ability to work with asynchronous data, manage state effectively, and build a modern, interactive frontend experience.</p>

            <p>My personal portfolio site highlights my development skills and projects with a polished and visually compelling design. It features a dynamic background built with Three.js, deployed through GitHub Pages, and developed using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The smooth animations and clear structure show your ability to create engaging, performant websites. This project serves not just as a showcase of my work, but reflects my creativity, clean code, and strong design principles.</p>

            <h3>Self-taught Computer Science GCSE in Python (2024)</h3>
            <p>Over just three months, I independently studied and completed the Computer Science GCSE, focusing primarily on Python. This fast-track learning experience gave me a strong foundation in programming concepts like algorithms, logic, and problem solving. I continued to study computer science at A-Level for a year, but later decided to shift my focus toward web development, where I found a stronger passion and clearer career path. That decision has led me to build real projects and constantly grow my skills in front-end technologies.</p>

            <h3>Web Development for Alexandra Dench Therapies (2025)</h3>
            <p>I built the website for Alexandra Dench Therapies, working closely with the client to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly platform that reflects her brand. From designing the layout to implementing responsive features, I ensured the site was visually appealing and easy to navigate. This project sharpened my front-end development skills and gave me valuable experience in real-world client communication and delivery.</p>
